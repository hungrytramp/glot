## usage

    ./glot.py [-f <filter>] -o <output>[:output-options] input1 ... > output

## output

- "svg-map[:<what>]" renders the input data to SVG and adds a OSM map as a background. you can use this to generate maps like [this](http://instagr.am/p/ThPim/) (this was me crossing Korea by bicycle, BTW).
- "svg-weighted[:<what>]" renders the input data to SVG without adding a map background and colors the segments based on how many times they appear in the input data. you can create some pretty nice stuff with this. examples to come.
- "plot:<xaxis>-<yaxis>" plots the elevation and/or speed against distance or time in PNG format. <xaxis> is either *distance* or *time*, <yaxis> is either *speed* or *elevation* or both, separated by comma.
- "kml[:<what>]" generates a KML, to be opened in Google Earth.
- "stats" prints some stats about the input file.

output options: "svg-map", "svg-weighted" and "kml" outputs all support rendering the path, the points or both. default is path, for others use the following syntax: "svg-map:points" or "svg-map:path,points".

## input

input files can be either GPX files or files generated by the Columbus V-900 GPS data logger. file type is guessed from the extension (*.gpx or *.CSV).

## filters

- "skip=n" will only consider every n points in the input. useful if you have a huge input but don't want a huge SVG/KML to be generated.
- "name-match-radius=m" will consider points which have the same name and are within a radius of m meters from each other to be the same point. examples to come.
